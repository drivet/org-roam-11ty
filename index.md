Welcome to [my](https://desmondrivet.com/about) [digital
garden](/20240521133232-digital_garden), a repository for notes, reviews,
recipes and whatever else strikes my fancy.  Though you are, of course,
welcome to explore (this site wouldn't be public otherwise), I wrote these
notes with only myself in mind, so you may not get much use out of them.

In theory you can start from anywhere and find your way around, but it makes
the most sense to start [at the top](/20240709181611-start_here).  If push
comes to shove you can visit my [page of all nodes](/all).

This garden is generated with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), via an [org
roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) note repository.
