#+title: Emacs General Strategy

I think I've been looking for whole, integrated systems for becoming
proficient with [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][emacs]], and I'm not totally convinced that there's an actual
way to do that.

So, maybe the only thing to do is to brute memorize a handful of tricks and
just use that to do what you need to do.
