#+title: Desmond's Digital Garden

Welcome to my attempt at a [[https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history][digital garden]], a repository for notes, beer
reviews, recipes, etc.  Think of it as a cross between a digital scrapbook
and a personal wiki.

[[https://maggieappleton.com/][Maggie Appleton]] probably has one of the nicest digital gardens I've seen.
Well worth exploring.

Though you are, of course, welcome to explore, I wrote them with only myself
in mind.  If you're interested in more public content, or learning more
[[https://desmondrivet.com/about][about me]], you may be more interested in my [[https://desmondrivet.com][website]], and my [[https://desmondrivet.com/posts/lifestream/][posts]] in
particular.  

I have a number of jumping off points::

 * I'm an [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] user, and I've accumulated a number of nodes on that subject
 * I have an interest in [[id:CAA54188-C8EF-4204-AB47-90A27514E2E8][Personal Information Management]]
 * I've staretd a [[id:35EC8663-3548-4E1F-9A94-AE8FB8D7B5E7][food and drink]] page.
