#+title: The Garden

Welcome to my [[id:E9DDE472-8D71-4547-992C-56D16AE6A5E5][digital garden]], a repository for notes, reviews, recipes and
whatever else strikes my fancy.  Though you are, of course, welcome to
explore (this site wouldn't be public otherwise), I wrote these notes with
only myself in mind, so you may not get much use out of them.

I have a number of jumping off points:

 * I'm an [[id:e8f63911-0c0b-4f37-9aed-b2e415144f9d][Emacs]] user, and I've accumulated a number of notes on that subject
 * I have an interest in [[id:CAA54188-C8EF-4204-AB47-90A27514E2E8][personal information management (pim)]]
 * I like cooking and drinking, so I have a [[id:35EC8663-3548-4E1F-9A94-AE8FB8D7B5E7][food and drink]] page.
