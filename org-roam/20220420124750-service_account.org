#+title: Service account (IAM)

A *Service account* is a special type of [[id:51ee32c1-582c-45d2-8f3a-95b3996f6a12][principal]] (in the past we called
these "users") that we use to access resources on behalf of a application.
In the past, I used to call these "application users", but "service account"
appears to be the new way of referring to this concept.

When you want an application to interact with a bucket, for example, you
generally have to:

 * create a service account for that application.
 * add [[id:93a73327-829e-4676-98f3-b86277ab5cb5][roles]] to that service account (not permissions).  Roles carry the
   permission with them.
