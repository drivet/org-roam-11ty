 * I like the Indieweb, not only because I own my own data but because I
   also am not locked into an application
 * Finished Leviathan Falls.  I found the ending too abrupt, like Neal
   Stephenson.
 * Added comments to my website, which go against IndieWeb principles.
 * I used to kind of admire the Catholic Church for resisting change
   throught the centuries, but as I get older I appreciate more one's
   ability to change, and the Catholic Church becomes more and more like a
   brutish fool who refuses to budge on anything.
