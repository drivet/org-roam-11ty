#+title: Yasnippet index

Yasnippet is a templating system for Emacs.  You type an abbreviation
followed by an expansion key (usually TAB) and you get the expanded text.

- [[http://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/][Documentation]]

Abbreviations are defined in snippet files, and are made available on a per
major mode basis.

Read the documentation for how to write a snippet. You basically just create
points in your file where the TAB key will bring you as you fill in the
fields.
