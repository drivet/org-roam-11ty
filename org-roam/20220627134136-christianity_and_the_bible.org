#+title: Christianity and the Bible

The Bible says a lot of things, and CHristians don't follow much of it (if
they did, they'd go to jail).  A lot of Christianity is base on cherry
picking bits from the Bible.

How people cherry pick depends on pre-exiting beliefs. The hate comes
_first_, the biblical justification comes second.
