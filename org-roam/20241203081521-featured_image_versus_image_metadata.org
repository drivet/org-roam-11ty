#+title: Featured image versus image metadata

The IndieWeb wiki has an article on the featured photo here:

https://indieweb.org/featured

The issue with featured photo is that it's identified with a microformat.
That means you need the photo to show up somewhere in your post for real.
In this sense, it's not really metadatsa.

OpenGraph, on the hand let's you define a literal metadata image, i.e. in
your meta tags, that is shown when you unfurl your post URL.  The image
doesn't have to appear anywjere in your posts.  It just *represents* your
post.
