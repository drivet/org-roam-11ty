TODO: make this into a reference.

 * Basically, focus on the process, or the direction, not the destination.
 * You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your
   systems.
 * Pointing and calling as a way to explicitly name habits, good or bad.
 * 1st law of behaviour change: make it obvious, can schedule a time and a
   place.  Or you can stack the habit on another habit if that habit is
   consistent.
 * Environment matters.  Make the cues of good habits obvious in your
   environment.
 * Easier to build new habits in a new environment.
