#+title: Seahorse Password and Keys

Seahorse is the GNOME (and Cinnamon) keyring, which managers passwords and
SSH keys.

It will load your private keys into memory, protected by a password which is
the same password you use to log in,

If you set a password on the private key, seahorse will ask you for the
password, and give you the option to unlock the private key at login time.
I think this only has to be done once.
