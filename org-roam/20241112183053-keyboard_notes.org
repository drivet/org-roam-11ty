Keyboard buying guide here:

Summary:

 * Full size, 100%, 04 keys, num pad
 * 96%, 100 keys, mostly like the 100% but more smooshed.
 * 80%, TKL (Tenkeyless), 87 key, basically just missing the number pad
 * 75%, compact TKL, 84 keys
 * 70%, 84 keys
 * 65%, 67 keys, no home cluster
 * 60%, 61 keys

I think that the 80% and 75% are the good ones for me.

** Switches
 * Red, linear, quiet
 * Brown, tactile, bump
 * Blue, clicky, loud
