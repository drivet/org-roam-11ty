Started learning Go, and it seems like a good compromise between something
like C and something like Java or Python.

** Go Modules

You have to enable go module tracking in your own module:

~go mod init your_module_name_here~

This ends up creating a go.mode and go.sum, used to keep track of your
current module, and the modules you use.

You can update the ~go.mod~ file by running:

~go mod tidy~

which will add/delete the module list based your source code.
