#+title: Emacs

* What is it?

A very old text editor dating back to the 70's.

Emacs is less of a text editor and more of a text editing platform.  You
can:

 * Use as a kind of IDE
 * Check your [[id:aaaefce4-768c-4609-ade9-4c22e093e7aa][email]]
 * [[id:FA31BDBE-5F87-4DEE-ABE2-D8AFD52F7D03][Organize TODO items]]

* Why use it?

 * Insanely configurable
 * Habit
 * Efficient if you know how to use it
 * Especially useful if you edit a lot of [[id:a2e09732-e1f9-4e01-a5fa-74092ae75cd5][plain text]]
 * Large ecosystem, email, TODO, etc.

It's a bit circular.  You use emacs because you edit a lot of text.  But you
arrange to edit a lot of text (choosing text formats, etc.) because editing
text can be done so effectively in Emacs.
